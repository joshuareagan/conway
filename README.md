# Conway's Game of Life

This is a Javascript implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The edges of the game board are 'toroidal'. By that I mean that the right and left edges are adjacent, as are the top and bottom edges.

A (slightly modified) version of this code is running at [my website](www.joshuareagan.com).
